## What is it about?

Epic React is a react course powered by [Kent C. Dots](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) and you can get it here [Link to his page](https://epicreact.dev/).

In this article I'm going to describe why I got this course at the first place and then succinctly share my thoughts about it.

## Why Epic React?

## Is it worth it?

Well, I don't know for sure yet. At the moment, I finished off the first workshop ( the fundamentals of react) and I can tell you that it is really cool. He keeps the videos short, and to be honest, you don't necessarily need it. There is a markdown file for every exercise explaining everything you need to know. So if you are a guy like me that has no much patience for videos, there you have it.
